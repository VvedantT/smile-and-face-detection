# Smile Detection Using Viola–Jones
Real-time face and smile detection system built using OpenCV, Haar cascades, and the Viola–Jones algorithm.

📌 Project Overview

This project implements a lightweight and fast smile detection system using classical computer vision techniques. The Viola–Jones framework is used for face detection, and Haar-cascade classifiers are used to detect smiles within the lower half of the face region.

The system works in real-time using a webcam and can distinguish between:

Neutral face

Smiling face

This makes it suitable for educational projects, demos, and simple computer vision applications.

🚀 Features

Real-time webcam detection

Face detection using Haar cascades

Smile detection with tuned parameters

Lightweight — runs without GPU

Works in Jupyter Notebook or as a Python script
